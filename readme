Description
We first crop the borders from the brain. Then we break the brain into
1x1x1, 3x3x3, and 5x5x5 grids.

We compute features for each voxel using 45-60 bin histogram, fourier
transform, and canny filter on all 3 axes. Then we reduce
dimensionality using a combination of PCA, ANOVA, and truncated SVD.

For each feature, we train using cross-validation with SVM,
logistic regression, and random forest. We use a 1-standard rule
to pick the best estimator, where we pick the estimator with
lowest standard deviation that is still within 1 standard
deviation from the estimator with lowest error.

Finally, we average all predictions using the sum of the cross-
validation error and standard deviation. We take the exponential
of the errors before weighting since they are log errors.
